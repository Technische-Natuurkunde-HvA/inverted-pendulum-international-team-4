- You are using the Github repository effectively to share code and data.
- Excellent weekly update! Your progress description is very clear.
- Wonderful you merged the output-response curves of both motors. Even better, you explained the differences and gained meaningful insights from this.
- The reflection is very detailed and shows critical thinking. Well done!
- Great you have included a video.
- Good idea to design and print a new wheel.
- Next week, please try to merge the two approaches from Lisbon and Amsterdam even further.

General recommendations to all teams:
- Place your weekly progress reports in reverse order, with the most recent week at the top.
- Do not be afraid of Markdown. If you wish, you could start by writing a basic text file in Word and later convert it to Markdown.
- Always add annotations or description to all graphs, pictures, videos, code and data you share in your weekly progress report. Do not assume these are self-explanatory; your readers rely on your explanations to understand their relevance and importance.
- The weekly progress reports form the foundation of your final written product. The more clear, detailed, and comprehensive your reports are, the better prepared you will be to complete your final product.
